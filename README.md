The algorithm finds solutions to the embedding problem for an order in a sextic CM field K and a prime p as presented in the paper "DETERMINING THE PRIMES OF BAD REDUCTION OF CM CURVES OF GENUS 3".

The code runs using Sage 9.0 or more recent versions that are running on top of Python 3. 

The file "How to Run.txt" explains how to run the algorithm for a CM field that is on the list "CM_Fields.sage". To add a new CM field see the file "How to add a new CM field.txt".
