The algorithm finds solutions to the embedding problem for an order in a sextic CM field K and a prime p as presented in the paper "Bounding denominators of CM hyperelliptic curves of genus 3" which is joint work with Sorina Ionica, Pinar Kilicer, Kristin Lauter, Elisa Lorenzo Garcia and Christelle Vincent.  

The code runs using Sage 9.0 or more recent versions that are running on top of Python 3, except a part which use Magma. Magma is also used to find the bases for the maximal orders that need to be given as arguments in later steps as described in the comments in the code. The online Magma calculator suffices in both situations.

Run the code according to the step numbers and the commented instructions at the beginning of each file.
