Paper: BOUNDING DENOMINATORS OF CM HYPERELLIPTIC CURVES OF GENUS 3 (joint work with SORINA IONICA, PINAR KILICER, KRISTIN LAUTER, ELISA LORENZO GARCIA AND CHRISTELLE VINCENT)

The algorithm finds solutions to the embedding problem for an order O in a sextic CM field K and a prime p.

The code is runs using Sage 9.0 or more recent versions that are running on top of Python 3. One step also uses Magma. The online Magma calculator suffices for that step.

Run the code according to the step numbers and the commented instructions at the beginning of each file.
